To fill a GameRound, you have to add an entry in the GameRounds field. Like so:

		{
			"FirstFormation": {
				"GridType": "SmallGrid",
				"EnemyType": "Bird",
				"SwirlFormations": ["CircularUp", "CircularDown"]
			},
			"SecondFormation": {
				"GridType": "MediumGrid",
				"EnemyType": "Butterfly",
				"SwirlFormations": ["CircularUp", "CircularDown"]
			},
			"ThirdFormation": {
				"GridType": "LargeGrid",
				"EnemyType": "Bee",
				"SwirlFormations": ["CircularUp", "CircularDown"]
			}
		}
